# Fitbit SDK Types ‚úî

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/fitbit-sdk-types.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/fitbit-sdk-types)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SergioMorchon/fitbit-sdk-types.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SergioMorchon/fitbit-sdk-types)

Add types to your Fitbit CLI project and work safely with TypeScript preventing you of doing stupid mistakes.

## ‚öô How to use in your app project

1. First, create your Fitbit CLI project following the official instructions at https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/command-line-interface/.
2. Then, from that project root, run `npx fitbit-sdk-types apply` to apply TypeScript to your existing Fitbit project.

You can also do it manually wit the following basic configuration files:

- `app/tsconfig.json`

```json
{
	"extends": "../tsconfig.json",
	"include": ["**/*.ts", "../node_modules/fitbit-sdk-types/types/device"]
}
```

- `companion/tsconfig.json`

```json
{
	"extends": "../tsconfig.json",
	"include": ["**/*.ts", "../node_modules/fitbit-sdk-types/types/companion"]
}
```

- `settings/tsconfig.json`

```json
{
	"extends": "../tsconfig.json",
	"include": [
		"**/*.ts",
		"**/*.tsx",
		"../node_modules/fitbit-sdk-types/types/settings"
	]
}
```

- `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
	"extends": "./node_modules/@fitbit/sdk/sdk-tsconfig.json"
}
```

## Benefits of using types

### Discoverability

Know what is available to build your ideas right from your code.

**Enumerated and strict string literals**

**Also in JSX for settings**

### Integrated with the Fitbit CLI build process

It is fully integrated within the Fitbit CLI build process that _already_ uses TypeScript. With this approach you are just _extending_ its knowledge about what can you use and how.

So if your code is not ok, then it won't build. That way it will prevent you from wasting a lot of time with typos, undefined functions and trivial bugs, letting you focus on what really matters.

**Code error, so the build process fails**

## Examples

You can see a ton of official examples working as tests right here, under the `./test-code-samples` path.

## Gotchas

### Be strict...

- üßê **To have a _full type experience_**: add the `strict` mode to your **tsconfig.json**:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"strict": true
	}
}
```

### ... Or not

You can always place `// @ts-ignore` right above that line of code that you know that _should_ work, and probably needs to have it's typings fixed.

## SDK Support

Only the latest SDK version is supported. Also don't expect this project version to match the official SDK version.
